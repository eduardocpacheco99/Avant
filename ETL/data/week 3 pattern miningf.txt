Graph pattern mining

A priori based

a size-k subgraph is frequent if and only of all this subgraphs are frequent.	

Candidated generated, candidate pruning, support counting, candidate elimination


Vertex Growing vs Edge Growing

AGM -> Apriori-based graph mining
FSG -> Frequent Subgraph


gSpan -> pattern Growth Approach
- Define a order
-  try to control the order of growth
- Flatten a graph into a sequence right most graph


Close Graphs: a graph G is closed if and only if are no supergraph of G with the same support as G.
Lossless compression


gIndex -> used in frequent subgraph
directly index substructures
INDEX ONLY CLOSED PATTERNS!
-> index discriminative substructures


SpiderMining

Pattern Based Classification:

CBA: classification based associations
CMAR:Rule pruning


Pattern frequency is tier to discriminative power
